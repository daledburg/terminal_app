2. Next while in the directory where the repository has been cloned, navigate to the src/dist folder where the executabl is located:

```bash
cd src/dist
```

3. From here, run the the program using:

```bash
./budget_buddy
```

4. This starts the application, from here follow onscreen instructions and enjoy!
