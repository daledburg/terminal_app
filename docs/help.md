This program requires the following dependencies to be able to be installed and run:

- The user must have python installed on their system. Please visit [Python Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions to install if this isnt up to date.
- The user must also have Git installed on your system. Please visit [Python Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions to install if this isnt already installed.

---

1. Once your system is up to date, the next step is to clone the repository from my personal Github repository using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daledburg/terminal_application.git
```

2. Next while in the directory where the repository has been cloned, execute the bash script.

```bash
bash budget_wrapper.sh
```

3. This will install the packages that are used in the script and will run the program as required.
