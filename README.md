## Implementation plan
### Purpose of design
This application is being designed as a bash-terminal based application using python. The goal in creating this application is to provide a useful tool for users to be able to understand their financial situation and provide facts and figures to help them make smarter financial decisions. It has multiple features to provide an array of different kinds of information that the user may want, while also providing the ability for the user to create their own profile to store this information.

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan.
Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
